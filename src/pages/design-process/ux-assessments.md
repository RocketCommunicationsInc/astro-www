The Astro UX Assessments can be used by designers, developers, product leaders, or anyone interested in improving software quality to complete a rapid assessment within 1-2 hours. These printable worksheets are especially useful in environments where outside computers aren’t allowed.

Applying all three evaluations is recommended to most effectively boost usability as each assessment reveals a unique insight into an applications’s User Experience.

## Usability Heuristics

The Astro Usability Heuristic Assessment is an evaluation that compares an application against long-standing best practices derived from the [Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-heuristics-complex-applications/).

**Benefits of Usability Heuristic Evaluations**

- Finds usability problems in a quick timeframe
- Combines multiple perspectives from evaluation insights
- Ranks initial issues by severity to prioritize future solutions

## Cognitive Walkthrough

The Astro Cognitive Walkthrough Assessment evaluates an application’s ease of use by observing and scoring a user’s success at each workflow step, revealing obstacles preventing task completion.

**Benefits of Cognitive Walkthroughs**

- Reveals early-stage constraints and improvements
- Identifies user issues and optimize work flows
- Discovers required user and system knowledge
