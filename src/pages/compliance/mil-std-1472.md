# MIL-STD-1472 Compliance

The Astro Space UX Design System is designed to support the development of custom space applications with established interaction patterns and best practices. To this end, Astro UXDS strives to achieve compliance with applicable DOD design standards. Astro 7 was audited to determine its level of compliance with relevant items in Section 5.17 (Information Systems) of <a href="https://quicksearch.dla.mil/qsdocdetails.aspx?ident_number=36903" target="_blank">MIL-STD-1472</a>, and as of September 29, 2022 this is our assessment of Astro UXDS compliance.

For the items determined to be Non-Compliant, we are looking at the level of effort to achieve compliance.

For the items determined to be Not Applicable to Astro UXDS, many times the onus is on the application developer to ensure compliance for those items is met. Astro UXDS often offers guidance or components that can help achieve compliance, but cannot do so directly.

| 5.17.2.3.1      | Natural organization of data. Query languages should reflect a data structure or organization perceived by users to be natural. For example, if a user would have reason to suppose that all data about a particular topic would be stored in one place, then the query language should permit such data to be retrieved by a single query, even though various pieces of data may be stored in different computer files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Not Applicable                                           |
| 5.17.2.3.2      | Coherent representation of data organization. A single representation of the data organization for use in query formulation shall be established (i.e., the user does not need to know if different queries will access different databases via different routes).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Not Applicable                                           |

Displayed forms shall be organized to group related items together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Compliant                                                |
| 5.17.6.3        | Format and content consistency. The format and content of displayed forms shall duplicate in every major parameter the (paper) form it is intended to represent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Not Applicable                                           |
| 5.17.6.4        | Advancing through form fields. When using TAB or ENTER keys to advance through form fields, the system shall require a response for every data entry field; advancing through a field (i.e., leaving a blank) for which no entry is desired shall require an explicit action (TAB or ENTER keystrokes).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Not Applicable                                           |

| 5.17.25.5       | Color recognition. When the user must recognize categories of information (e.g., represent different variables on a graph, different types of information on a map) a maximum of 11 nameable colors shall be used to represent and distinguish between categorically different information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Compliant                                                |
| 5.17.25.6       | Color differentiation. When using color to group elements of a display together (i.e., to show parts are related or different) and the color has no meaning beyond a grouping function, colors should be discriminable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Compliant                                                |
| 5.17.25.7       | Saturation coding. Hue saturation may be used to indicate relative intensity (e.g., best, hottest, wettest, safest, deepest). The following are standardized uses of saturation that should be followed: a. Hotter to cooler where saturation changes from red to blue. b. More dangerous to less dangerous – saturation of red increases as danger increases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Compliant                                                |

| 5.17.25.10      | Color-blind users. If the user population includes color-blind users, every effort should be made for non-confusable colors to be used for coding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Compliant                                                |

If non-confusable colors cannot be used for coding for color-blind users, redundant coding shall be used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Compliant                                                |
| 5.17.25.12      | Induced color-blindness. Operational requirements occasionally result in the need to introduce protective eyewear, visors, or other filters in the optical path that are designed to absorb or reflect measurable and uniquely specifiable wavelengths of directed energy within the visible spectrum. This results in selectively induced color deficiencies or color blindness. As such, color coding in display design shall not be the only means of coding information for affected operational systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Compliant                                                |

| 5.17.25.16.1    | Color contrast. Colored symbols shall differ from their background by not less than 100 ΔE (color difference) (CIE L*u*v*) distances when calculated using the formula below. The elements required for the calculation are the luminance (Y), the UCS coordinates (u', v') for foreground and background colors, and the maximum luminance for the display (YM). As with the (CIE L*u*v*) distances, caution should be used in assessing legibility for characters in colors having small luminance differences. This caution applies not only to characters in color but also to small luminance differences in background colors and for very small luminance differences between characters in color and background in color. Unusually large or small characters may lead to erroneous estimates of legibility. The metric is as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                                | Non-Compliant                                            |

| 5.17.26.3       | Brightness inversion. When a capability for brightness inversion is available (so-called “reverse video” where dark characters on a bright background can be changed under computer control to bright on dark, or vice versa), it may be used for highlighting critical items that require user attention. When a capability for brightness inversion is available and when used for alerting purposes, brightness inversion shall be reserved for that purpose and not be used for general highlighting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Compliant                                                |
