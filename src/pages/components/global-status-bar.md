<!-- The Global Status Bar is a full width view across the top of an application — an area commonly reserved for global status, global command and top-level navigation. -->

## Appearance and Behavior

The Global Status Bar has four main parts: App Icon, App Title, App State, and Logged-in Username. Additional custom features can be added to the Global Status bar. Suggested elements include Clock, Monitoring Icons, and Buttons.
