## Interactive Example

::tag{ is=a-playground tag=rux-tabs }

## Rules of Thumb

- Use only one row of Tabs.
- Use higher level Tabs only on top of the panel.
- Tab labels should not be more than two words and should accurately reflect what underlying content the user can expect to reveal.
- Use title-style capitalization for labels.
- High level Tabs are often used to organize an application by work process.

:::note
<span>
High Level Tabs are often process/workflow oriented. Process oriented Tabs should:

- Appear in the upper left quadrant.
- Be clearly labeled.
- Guide users through a sequential process.

## Interior/Compact Tabs

For use outside of main navigation, a more compact Tab component can be used.

## Rules of Thumb

- Use only one row of Tabs.
- Tab labels should not be more than two words and should accurately reflect what the user can expect to see.
- Use sentence case capitalization for labels.
