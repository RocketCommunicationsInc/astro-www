## Interactive Example

::storybook-demo

<!-- A Switch toggles between two mutually exclusive states such as "On" or "Off." Unlike a Checkbox, a Switch initiates an action with immediate effect without requiring a "Save" or "Submit" action. -->

## Rules of Thumb

- Use a Switch for immediate state changes between two mutually exclusive options.
- For non-immediate changes, use [Radio Buttons](/components/radio-button) for mutually exclusive options or [Checkboxes](/components/checkbox) for non-exclusive options.
- For immediate actions instead of state changes, use an [action Button](/components/button).
- On a page, each Switch is independent of all other Switches.
- An intelligent default should be set for the initial state of a Switch.

## Appearance and Behavior

A Switch consists of a circular button that slides across a track to display the "Off" (left) or "On" (right) state. Clicking anywhere on the Switch component will cause the Switch to change states immediately.
