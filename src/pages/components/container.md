# Container

::storybook-demo

## Usage/Design Guidelines

Containers are used to group multiple components into a specific area that allows them to flow in a flexible/responsive manner. Containers can be used to help effectively manage lists, tables, dialogs, modals, slide out panels, content containers (top and bottom), and other components.

The **Parent Container** has sections for a header, a tab bar, a toolbar, body content, and a footer.

The Container component uses an optional **drop shadow** that can help distinguish it from other UI elements (e.g. applied in “overlay” situations, such as dialogs and slide-in panels).

The **Child Container** consists of a header, left slot, right slot, and body sections. The body section can be used as a canvas to freely overlay multiple components.
