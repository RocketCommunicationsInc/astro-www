# Card

::storybook-demo

A “card” is a UI design pattern that groups related information in a flexible-size container visually resembling a playing card. Within the Astro system, card sits on top of a container.

A card is a container for a few short, related pieces of information. It roughly resembles a playing card in size and shape, and is intended as a linked, short representation of a conceptual unit.

## Rules of Thumb

Limit actions on a card. Actions should be simple, direct, and predictable. Actions should clearly indicate what will happen when selected.

Display content with a logical hierarchy, setting clear prioritization of content.

Cards should be self-contained, without relying on surrounding elements for context. It cannot be merged, divided, or split.

Copy should be scannable; content is crisp, brief, and focused. Actionable language is preferred. Passive voice should be avoided.

Identify “Hero content”, but limit them to 1-2 elements. These draw attention.

Content should be actionable. Structured with visual hierarchy to bring prominence to important content. Be clear about content that requires user action.

## Appearance and Behavior

Cards contain content and actions about a single subject.

Cards have a header with left and right slots, footer, and body slot where custom content can be inserted. A slot is an invisible space holder in the foundation of the design that allows outside content to be inserted into the component in the place of it, while maintaining the component’s structure and behavior while integrating the new element. Card can have any, all or none of its elements visible. The body slot can accept any kind of content, from images to text, as long as it fits within the slot.

Cards have 4 key properties:

- Grouping information
- Presenting summary content & a link to additional details
- Resemble playing cards
- Allow for flexible layouts

## Compliance rules

Use sentence case unless an extenuating circumstance arises.

![Do: Group content that is short and scannable with obvious hero content and a clear action item.](/img/components/card-do-1.png 'Do: Group content that is short and scannable with obvious hero content and a clear action item.')

![Don’t: Clutter the card with long blocks of text, multiple hero items, or any not easily scannable and un-actionable content where the purpose is unclear. ](/img/components/card-dont-1.png 'Don’t: Clutter the card with long blocks of text, multiple hero items, or any not easily scannable and un-actionable content where the purpose is unclear.

![Do: Keep cards in a container the same size, and cards used in similar contexts across the application a consistent size. ](/img/components/card-do-2.png 'Do: Keep cards in a container the same size, and cards used in similar contexts across the application a consistent size. ')

![Don’t: Vary the size of cards in a group or container, or use different sized cards in similar situations across the application. ](/img/components/card-dont-2.png 'Don’t: Vary the size of cards in a group or container, or use different sized cards in similar situations across the application.
