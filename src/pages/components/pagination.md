## Rules of Thumb

- Do not use underlined text except for in hovered elements.
- Use Pagination only when necessary. Instead, think about editing the content to fit onto one page.
- Make each page a similar length.
- If there is only one page, no Pagination is needed.
- Be sure the current page is easily distinguishable from other pages referenced by the Pagination
