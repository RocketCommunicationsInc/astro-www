		How You Can Help
	</h2>

	<h3>Initiate Conversations with Key Decision-Makers</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Engage with program managers, design leads, and technical leaders about the ongoing value of AstroUXDS. Gather feedback on outcomes, roadmaps, and support needs.</li>
		<li><strong>Helpful talking points (feel free to adapt):</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>How AstroUXDS accelerates delivery and improves accessibility across teams.</li>
				<li>Specific examples where continued investment could unlock new capabilities (e.g., new components, advanced tooling, streamlined workflows).</li>
				<li>Anticipated benefits you'd like to see featured in a public-facing quote or case study.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>If there's a preferred contact channel or process for discussing funding, share it so we can align with your workflow.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Talking Points Quick-Start:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>"AstroUXDS unifies our UI language, speeds delivery, and improves accessibility across our products."</li>
		<li>"Sustaining AstroUXDS ensures we keep delivering secure, scalable experiences for users."</li>
		<li>"A continued investment in AstroUXDS enables faster time-to-market and better developer experience."</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>If You Can Give Us a Quote We Can Use</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Use the <a href="#quote-form">form below</a> to submit your quote. You may choose to submit anonymously, but including a general industry or mission area (e.g., PNT, SDA) adds valuable context. You can see some previous quotes from users on our Who's Using Astro page</li>
		<li>A concise leadership quote (1–2 sentences) describing how AstroUXDS supports your product strategy and roadmap is one of the most impactful ways to help. With your consent, we'll feature it in marketing and supporter materials after review.</li>
		<li><em>Consent note: Quotes will be used only with explicit permission and reviewed prior to publication.</em></li>
	</ul>

	<h2>
		Why AstroUXDS Matters
	</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Delivers broad reach across all USSF missions, establishing a consistent, reliable baseline.</li>
		<li>Technology- and vendor-agnostic — no single organization owns Astro, ensuring openness and neutrality.</li>
		<li>Freely accessible without restrictive access controls, empowering designers and developers to start using it immediately.</li>
		<li>Purpose-built to meet government and industry standards, addressing challenges unique to the Department of Defense and US Space Force.</li>
		<li>Backed by first-class support with ticket responses in under 24 hours and average resolution times of just 1.1 days — service levels rarely matched by larger, more generic design systems.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>
		Astro's Impact to Date
	</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Wide reach:</strong> AstroUXDS is actively used by 60+ known applications across four USSF program offices — Space Sensing, BMC3I, Comms & PNT, and SDA — as well as more than 40 organizations, including all major DoD primes. This broad adoption enables a unified design language at scale, translating into measurable efficiency and faster delivery across teams.</li>
		<li><strong>Real-world ROI and efficiency:</strong> Using industry-standard ROI modeling for design systems and conservative adoption assumptions, AstroUXDS saves the U.S. government an estimated $3.44 million annually through reduced duplication, faster delivery, and improved cross-team efficiency. These savings grow as adoption expands and reuse compounds across programs.</li>
		<li><strong>Substantial adoption and activity:</strong> Beyond hundreds of thousands of installs and steady usage across documentation and components, AstroUXDS enables high-impact, cross-program initiatives. For example, a recent research and industry engagement effort on the C2MS specification for error messages supported not only all five USSF program offices but all branches of the armed forces. The effort was completed in 400 hours; replicating this work for Space Force alone would have cost over $200,000, meaning AstroUXDS saved the government at least $160,000 in this instance.</li>
		<li><strong>Known breadth of usage and impact:</strong> We have confirmed participation across dozens of programs, projects, and organizations, all benefiting from AstroUXDS' consistency and dependability.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>
		What Continued Funding Unlocks
	</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Alignment with established and emerging standards critical to mission success, including MIL-STD-1472, MIL-STD-2525, WCAG 2, and evolving frameworks such as the MOSA ISTO UX/UI Standards, APCA Contrast, and Temporal guidelines. This ensures AstroUXDS remains interoperable, future-ready, and fully compliant with the needs of defense and government systems.</li>
		<li>New components, patterns, and tools — developed directly from user and program engagements — that solve unique challenges in DoD programs and accelerate product delivery.</li>
		<li>Tools and resources to support the AI/LLM landscape, enabling faster implementation of Astro across a wider range of architectures while reducing onboarding overhead.</li>
	</ul>
