<h2> Release Schedule</h2>

During 2022, Astro will publish minor and patch updates on a bi-weekly basis on Thursday and major updates on a bi-annual cadence. Astro patch/minor releases may include updates to design assets, compliance, components, design tokens and documentation.

<h3>Semantic Versioning</h3>

Astro uses Semantic Versioning or <a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank">SemVer</a>, a widely adopted method of conveying meaning about the change. SemVer is expressed as three numbers delimited by a decimal point (1.4.3). While SemVer has quite a lot of nuance, for Astro we are adopting the basic patch, minor, and major nomenclature.

<div class="note">
    <p>Unlike standard decimals, each numeral is separated by a full-stop, increments numerically, and resets the numbers to the right. E.g., making a minor change to version 1.9.3 would result in a new version number of 1.10.0. There is no limit to how high each number can go, but practically speaking anything beyond 999 becomes unwieldy.</p>
