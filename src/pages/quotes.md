## Community Feedback

Here are some quotes from our community about their experience with Astro:

---

> "Astro is an unqualified success. We partnered with a small business to bring state of the art technology directly to warfighters in a way that improved outcomes. Astro is a model for how to do tech transition."

**Col (ret) Rhett Turnbull**

> "Astro UXDS played a pivotal role in the rapid development of the next generation of C3 tools for Space Force. On R2C2, designers and developers were able to quickly build and deploy concepts at scale.
>
> By integrating UX best practices with established design patterns, Astro enabled the team to focus on solving complex, mission-critical challenges and use cases, rather than creating a design language from scratch.
>
> It was through these more intricate use cases that the team identified additional user needs, which led to the creation of new design patterns, unique to the C3 space. Astro proved instrumental in accelerating a proof of concept, resulting in a faster time to market and positive feedback from users."

> "The Astro UX Design System, along with its associated web components and team support, played a crucial role in the design and development of the ATLAS system. By leveraging the design system, the design team experienced an increase in velocity during the design process. This was achieved through the availability of pre-built, tested, and standards-compliant design elements and patterns that enabled the team to swiftly create screen layouts and workflows. Following validation by the user community, the Astro web components facilitated the seamless translation of these designs into a functional system by the development team. In instances where discrepancies arose between the existing and desired functionality, the Astro team offered valuable support to address these gaps or propose workarounds in cases where immediate resolution was not feasible."

> "It was very helpful to use Astro. In the beginning we were using the ServiceNow Horizon design system and Figma components, then another custom ServiceNow theme, but it was pretty frustrating and difficult. Once we realized we didn't need to use those, and could just straight out create our own custom Astro theme using Astro's Design Tokens, things were much more smooth. The conversion to the Astro theme took about a week, and we could adjust quickly from there."

> "Astro covers 80% + of our use cases in this. Add that up across all the teams and it's certainly a large cost/schedule savings. I would argue even more importantly than the cost/schedule implications, you actually end up with a modern/consistent UI/UX for the entire Ground system which has even greater long tail implications for TTPs, maintenance, etc â€¦"

> "Thank you so much for your teams lighting fast response to our questions. We are working on project, trying to deploy a front end, and Astro[UXDS] is one of our requirements. Our client is eager to see front end improvements and your team's help has been invaluable in allowing us to get our code deployed and in front of the client."

> "The biggest advantage to Astro as a design system for space is that it is purposely constructed to be a force multiplier for Guardians. In my observation working with Astro these past few years, the time spent by the design team conducting workflow analysis and designing for efficient use has produced a system that will both reduce training time and improve operations.
>
> Guardians or any users of Astro compliant systems benefit from the same look, feel, and overall function to understand software applications in the same way a user of the Microsoft Office or Apple Ecosystem understands key elements of user facing features.
>
> By eliminating the learning curve for so many disparate systems from various development teams, complex SatOps software can be more intuitive and allow focus on the aspects of the mission that matter most vs. having to learn everything every time a guardian moves units. In this regard, I see Astro as a key part of efficiently enabling space superiority attainment given monetary and manpower constraints of the Space Force. To consistently do more with less requires smarter system and design. Astro plays a huge role to that end."
