description: The FDS system supports missions that require communication between satellites and ground systems.
class: fds

:::note
While the Maneuvering and Reporting tools have not been researched, tested, and designed to the same depth as the Orbit Determination Tool, they have been considered throughout the research and design process from the broader perspective of the application.
:::

The FDS system supports missions that require communication between satellites and ground systems in order to estimate the position of a satellite, as well as perform any maneuvers to keep the satellite in a nominal position. Some key features of FDS include Orbit Determinations (OD), generating products (Ephemerides, TLE’s, reports, etc.), and Maneuvering, such as station keeping, conjunction assessment, and COLA’s (burns).

## UX Research Findings

### Inefficient and redundant tasks frustrate OA’s

An efficient FDS application should automate redundant tasks for the operator, as well as create a unified experience across the enterprise, reducing the training time it takes for OA’s to learn the system and begin contributing meaningful work right away.

UX research conducted in collaboration with users and domain experts on existing FDS workflows and systems identified the following:

**Redundancy**:

One of the biggest hurdles for OA’s was the inefficient repetitiveness in which their tasks are performed.

**Pain Points**:

- Navigating through system folders was laborious, as the system did not recall and retrieve the appropriate folder path logic.
- Hours were spent manually transferring data from a primary system to secondary workstations. This results in running the risk of data relics being improperly stored or lost.
- For every new satellite OD, it was required to close and reopen the software. This process added time to their daily workload.

**FDS Design Solution**:
Implementing smarter logic into the system to allow the OA to retrieve data in more efficient ways.

### There is not a current, unified FDS solutions

UX Research also revealed that each mission used their own, sometimes unique set of tools to perform similar tasks. Some of these findings include:

**Dispersed software**:

While some operations use older legacy systems to perform tasks like OASYS, other operations use off the shelf 3rd party commercial software (AGI STK, ODTK) – and others may build their own systems to meet their needs (OCEAN, TRAPEZE). Each user had strong opinions in favor or against their missions FDS software.

**Pain Points**:

- The OASYS legacy system did not provide the 2D/3D visualization that is often times helpful for visual minded operators, or when explaining solutions to leadership.
- Programs like FreeFlyer came with too many options with a small margin of error, resulting in user input errors.
- Key information is often times not accessible in the operators current software solution which costs time when tracking and identifying necessary data from outside sources.

**Operator training and retention**:

- The training and onboarding time to learn these softwares can be very involved.
- Just because an OA is trained, does not mean they are proficient. Often times OA’s are reassigned after just a few months and never fully get immersed enough to be able to contribute to the mission. This is why most advanced OA’s often times are contractors.
- Some OA’s are hybrid TT&C operators, they may bounce through many different applications to perform tasks, each one with a different user experience and interface.

**FDS Design Solution**:

- **Using best practice UX Design**. Leveraging the ASTRO UX Design System allow operators from different missions to learn one set of user interface components. This helps onboard and train new OA’s to begin contributing to the mission immediately, as well as transitioning existing OA’s by allowing them to focus more on their mission and less on learning a new system.
- **Tabular Data and Visual Data**. While some users interviewed were more ‘data people,’ there was a strong desire to visualize the orbit through a 2d/3d simulation, as some operators understand and digest visual information more effectively. We identified areas of the application where this data existed and integrated more system flexibility by allowing an OA to switch views between tabular data and visual data.
- **3rd party solutions**. Inspiration was drawn from the off-the-shelf products created for Flight Dynamics such as FreeFlyer and ODTK. We wanted to leverage the thinking behind these softwares that our users were partial to, while adhering to the unique capabilities of the FDS legacy software, OASYS. The FDS designs include customizable “Scenarios” that allow OA’s to create or pre-load any orbit determination type as well as generate any necessary products or reports with minimal effort.
- **Creating Utility Tool Kits**. Identify and abstract the key common features shared between the dispersed tool sets. This lead to the creation of Utility Tool Kits. Utility Tool Kits are temporary work environments for key subtasks such as filtering track data or propagating a satellite. User testing revealed that different missions do these in different order. By leaving the subtasks open and agnostic to the mission, users can approach orbit determinations in each of their unique ways.

## UX Design

Based on this initial research and follow-up design iterations with operators and stakeholders, the resulting design effort focused on a common, streamlined design, reducing the redundancy in user tasks required to support key functionality and task flows, while remaining agnostic enough to support unique mission needs. The app is designed to occupy its own browser window, allowing operators to focus on the task at hand, while possessing Utility Tool Kits that allow operators to access secondary workflows without using up the screens default real estate. The FDS app is set up to support single or multi-monitor work station configurations.

## Framework

Based on system requirements and user research, the architecture of the application provides the guidance needed to build an FDS app, yet remains agnostic to the mission needs.

## FDS Orbit Determination

For operators of the FDS Application, flexibility and automating redundant tasks are key. The FDS App supports missions and their unique work flows, as well as the customization of common scenarios, allowing OA’s to load and store attributes that are unique to each satellite, without having to reinvent the wheel each time.

### Global Status Bar

The [Global Status Bar](../../components/global-status-bar) of the FDS App contains a single sign in, high level navigation [tabs](../../components/tabs) to switch between tools, a [clock](../../components/clock) and notification, chat and help icons. [Monitoring icons](../../components/icons-and-symbols) may be included if the mission requires additional situational awareness.

1. **App Switcher Menu** - The App Switcher Menu allows the operator to launch new instances of different apps, sign in/sign out, and edit preferences. The App Name appears directly to the right of the menu.
2. **Navigation Tabs** - The navigation tabs allow the operator to switch between workspaces or tools.
3. **Global Clock** - The global Clock is central to FDS service task flows, so it is included in the Global Status Bar.
4. **Monitoring Icons**\* - The monitoring icons communicate status to an operator. Each icon displays a color associated with the status level and a badge to indicate the number of alerts.
5. **Notification**\*, Chat and Help Icons - notification, chat and help icons display system messages, while chat handles the human-to-human messaging

\* Functionality for these components is pending user testing

### Scenarios

:::two-col
![Scenarios wireframe](/img/service-specific-ux-design/fds-scenarios.png)
:::col

The scenarios panel is where a task begins. Depending on common mission tasks, operators may create, edit, or delete scenarios that best fit their workflows. For example, if an operator performs orbit determinations on Mondays for each satellite they are responsible for, they might create a “Nominal OD” scenario. Clicking a satellite in this scenario would load its last state, its last input files, and pre-select all the necessary products and reports needed for this task.

1. **Expandable/Collapsible Scenario Groups** - Expands to show items, such as spacecrafts, grouped in the respected scenario for quickly loading the attributes for the scenario.
2. **Create New Scenario** - Allows operators to create and name new scenarios.
