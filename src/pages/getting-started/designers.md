# Getting Started For Designers

Astro UXDS design assets include files for creating Astro application mockups and wireframes in Figma.

Before reading any further, we recommend you review available Astro components on the [Astro Storybook](https://astro-components.netlify.app/?path=/story/astro-uxds-welcome-start-here--page) site. Examples of Astro in-use can be seen within the Astro [Service Specific](/service-specific-ux-design/) Design pages.

## Astro and EGS Design Compliance

The Astro team has worked with EGS to establish the EGS Design Compliance requirements for developers targeting the EGS Platform. These requirements are specific to EGS development; these requirements are based on common best practices and accessibility guidelines and it is highly recommended for all users to incorporate them into their applications.

## MIL-STD-1472 Compliance

Astro strives to achieve compliance with applicable DOD design standards. Astro 7 was audited to determine its level of compliance with relevant items in Section 5.17 (Information Systems) of [MIL-STD-1472H](https://quicksearch.dla.mil/qsdocdetails.aspx?ident_number=36903), and as of September 29, 2022 this is our assessment of Astro UXDS compliance.
