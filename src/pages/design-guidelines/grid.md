 Ensuring a consistent [grid system](https://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/grid-theory-41411345) within your application and across all Astro applications creates a sense of continuity and relationship from screen to screen and app to app, even when the layouts between those screens may have dramatically different requirements.

## Columns, Gutters and Margins

The Astro Grid is a standard 12 [column](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-column) grid with column widths that expand or contract in relation to the width of the display. Columns are separated by a fixed-width [gutter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/column-gap). Astro-compliant applications may use gutters of either 24 pixels (default) or 12 pixels (compact). The grid is enclosed by a fixed-width margin of 24 pixels. These specifications are for screen resolutions of 769px to 1920px max width.

## Breakpoints

At certain screen sizes, Astro optimizes for display on narrow devices by reducing the number of columns and rearranging the layout of your application via [responsive design](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/responsive/) practices.

## 4-px Grid

A 4-px horizontal grid at 1920px resolution has been provided to help designers align layouts on a 4-px system with greater precision.

:::note
[CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) is the recommended method for implementing a grid in your Astro project. Using a custom layout grid adds overhead and layers of incompatibility, and as such, should only be used if your project requires backwards-compatibility with Internet Explorer 9 or earlier.
