The Service Specific UX Design effort supported Space Systems Command (SSC) in developing consistent, robust applications. The design efforts achieved this goal by applying UX Design processes aligned with the Astro Space UX Design System to create, document, and implement baseline designs as interactive sample applications. The work focused on two key services, [Ground Resource Management (GRM)][grm-designs] and [Telemetry, Tracking & Command (TT&C)][ttc-designs] and followed this process:

- Conduct [UX research](/design-process/research) with users and stakeholders to identify key task flows, constraints, and current pain points in existing systems
- Apply the Astro Space UX Design System to [design](/design-process/ui-design) solutions supporting GRM and TT&C Services
- Partner with users and stakeholders to evaluate and improve designs, ensuring efficient and usable task flows
- Implement designs as interactive sample applications using the [Astro UI Components](/components/readme)
- Provide design specifications, wireframes, sample applications, and source code as [downloadable resources](/downloads) for teams developing GRM and TT&C Service applications

Design efforts included hours of user and stakeholder interviews, detailed task flow analysis, and iterative design evaluations based on user feedback. The design activities produced definitive sample application designs for developing future GRM and TT&C applications, establishing consistent and functional user experience across systems.

## GRM Service UX Design

The UX research conducted on GRM services drove the design of three sample applications integrated into the GRM App Suite. The [GRM Dashboard][grm-dashboard] provides space situational awareness to the operator by consolidating mission-critical information related to contacts and equipment. The GRM App Suite supports comprehensive secondary tasks for managing contacts and equipment in the [GRM Schedule][grm-schedule] and [GRM Equipment Manager][grm-equipment] applications.

## TT&C Service UX Design

The UX research for TT&C services resulted in the TT&C App Suite design supporting ground-to-satellite communications, constellation monitoring, and spacecraft health maintenance.

The [TT&C Monitor][ttc-monitor] application enables operators to track status, alerts, health and function of individual satellites and constellations.

[TT&C Monitor App][ttc-monitor]

The [TT&C Command][ttc-command] application manages data transmission between ground systems and spacecraft through defined command sets.

[TT&C Command App][ttc-command]

The [TT&C Investigate][ttc-investigate] application supports investigation of spacecraft alerts, anomalies and analysis of subsystem mnemonics, measurements, and limits.
