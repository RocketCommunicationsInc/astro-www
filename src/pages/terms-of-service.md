      <li><strong>Limited Warranty:</strong> Rocket warrants the Software, as delivered in the one-time download, will perform substantially per its accompanying documentation for 90 days from the date of receipt (proof of purchase required). If the Software is defective within 90 days of original purchase, Rocket’s sole obligation will be, at its discretion, to either replace the Software free of charge or return the purchase price, at which point all licenses terminate. This warranty does not cover any updates, future versions, or ongoing services as none are provided by Rocket.</li>
      <li><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> EXCEPT FOR THE ABOVE LIMITED WARRANTY, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT ANY OTHER WARRANTIES (EXPRESS OR IMPLIED), INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, ALL OF WHICH YOU WAIVE.

    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong>

  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ROCKET COMMUNICATIONS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, REVENUE, OR GOODWILL, OR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES ARISING FROM THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. This limitation does not apply to breaches of confidentiality obligations. In jurisdictions not allowing such limitations, Rocket’s liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Confidential Information</strong>

  Each party agrees to protect the other’s Confidential Information with at least reasonable care, and no less than it uses for its own similar information. Confidential Information shall only be used for purposes of this Agreement and not disclosed to third parties, except to representatives with a need to know who are bound by similar confidentiality duties. Each party is responsible for its representatives' compliance.

  Obligations do not apply to information that: (a) is public through no fault of the receiver; (b) was already known to the receiver without confidentiality obligations; (c) is rightfully received from a third party not under confidentiality obligations; or (d) is independently developed by the receiver without using the discloser's Confidential Information.


  If required by law to disclose Confidential Information, the receiving party will notify the disclosing party (if legally permitted) to allow for a protective order. Unauthorized disclosure may cause irreparable harm, entitling the disclosing party to seek injunctive relief.
