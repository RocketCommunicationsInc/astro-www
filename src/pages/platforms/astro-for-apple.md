## Toolkits

**Astro Swift Foundation** has everything developers need to bring Astro to their Swift UI apps, including components, colors, symbols, and data types. Foundation is an open source [Swift package](https://github.com/RocketCommunicationsInc/AstroSwiftFoundation) built upon [Astro Design Tokens](https://www.astrouxds.com/design-tokens/getting-started/).

**Astro Swift Core** contains Astro’s reference colors and is an open source [Swift package](https://github.com/RocketCommunicationsInc/AstroSwiftCore).

**Astro Swift Utilities** is a collection of handy [Swift code](https://github.com/RocketCommunicationsInc/AstroSwiftUtilities) used in our sample apps.

All toolkits and sample apps are based on Astro 7 and require iOS 16, macOS 13, tvOS 16, and watchOS 9.

## Features

* UI colors, status colors, classification colors, and data visualization colors are available as Xcode assets, wrapped as native color types, and mapped to semantic colors.

* Status Symbols and Astro Icons are available as scalable SF Symbols.
Components unique to Astro (Status Symbol, Tag, Clock, Interval Timer, and Classification Markings) are available as cross-platform SwiftUI Views.

* Native platform components, such as Button, Slider, and Toggle, are tinted with Astro’s interactive color.

* Data types such as status level and classification are available as native Swift types.

* Documentation is available in Xcode and [online](https://rocketcommunicationsinc.github.io/AstroSwiftFoundation/documentation/astroswiftfoundation/).
